# BUILDDEPS

## Notes
* Release mode *MUST* be built first, otherwise, osgEARTH won't be able to find OSG (this is silly)

* GDAL - For building on Windows, Git must support long filenames.  To do this:
git config --system core.longpaths true

* VCPKG - make sure any VCPKG integrations are disabled.   If this isn't done, this
build will pick up libraries from VCPKG instead of locally built.


VCPKG Branches:
2021.4.30
osgEarth 3.1
